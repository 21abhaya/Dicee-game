# Dicee-game
These are the projects I've built building while learning how to code.

Most of the HTML was pre-written. Added styling using CSS, based on the given guidelines. The objective was to learn the basics of DOM manipulation using JavaScript, while playing with various HTML elements 
and CSS properties. The outcome was a single page website that would compare the result of dice rolls among two dice and the higher number dice would be the winner, with necessary information appearing on the 
page itself.
